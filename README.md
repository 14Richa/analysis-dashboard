# OCF Internal UI
This will be a Streamlit app that serves as a dashboard for the OCF team that reports database statistics.

Currently you'll need to install the nowcasting datamodels:
`pip install nowcasting_datamodel` or maybe `pip3 install nowcasting_datamodel`

## Running Streamlit

Install streamlit: `pip install streamlit` or `pip3 install streamlit`

Check that streamlit installed: `streamlit hello`

Run the app: `streamlit run main.py`
